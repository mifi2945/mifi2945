### How this Works
In this repo, you will find a variety of things. One is the existence of **multiple branches**. Each branch is dedicated to a project. For example, a branch called `API_App` is a current project where I experiment with Maven builds and Java APIs! My hope is to have many branches in the following year to come.

### `API_App`
This application will be a country trivia game that relies on an API full of countries (you can find the link [here](https://nationnode.vercel.app/)). The goal of the game will be to guess the country by flag, any neighboring countries you know, and get within a reasonable population size of the country. A `README.md` will be made with more info for that specific branch. Fun! 🗺️

### A Little About Me (and my skills!⚙️)
Hi there! My name is Mikhail Filippov, and I am a current sophomore student at Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) 🏴‍☠️ studying Computer Science; in addition to that, I have minors in Computer Engineering and Mathematics. My top languages include **Java**, **C**, **Python**, and Russian (not coding heh). I am in the process of self-teaching **HTML** and **JavaScript** and associated libraries, such as **React** and **Node.js**, which I hope to use to build some personal projects to post online! 😊 Some of the other skills I have include: Git (obviously), Assembly Programming (x86), Linux Operating Systems, JavaFX, Pandas, NumPy, VHDL, ML, and public presentations.

In my academic career, I have covered a variety of topics, from **operating systems** to **Scrum** to **advanced algorithms and data structures**. I am an eager learner and love to take on new challenges, which is why I tacked on the CE minor. In a current course, Embedded systems, we did projects I never thought I would. Through this course, I learned how to **solder**! By putting together my own board with a variety of peripherals and I/O devices, I am able to both learn soldering as a skill and have a device that I can program from scratch in **C**.

An incredible journey I had the honor to take part in and contribute to was presenting research at the 2024 MICS (Midwest Instruction and Computing Symposium) conference in Minneapolis, MN with a team of six. The TL;DR of the research paper, titled "Using AI to Detect Lies: Determining the Truthfulness of Math LLMs" and linked in my [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/mikhail-filippov/), is the testing and determination on if math large language models (LLMs) are able to lie. This was conducted by use of black box testing, with prompts to lie and elicitation questions. The research process took from September of 2023 to the presentation at MICS, April of 2024. This was a very intruguing and insightful experience, with a long journey all the way to the Twin Cities! 📜

### So What Is This For?
The point of this repo will be to store my personal projects, and maybe later publish them! This will help me experiment around with new languages and improve my skills in the coming months / years. 💻
